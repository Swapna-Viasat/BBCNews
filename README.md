Introduction

This simple Android app application for displaying the news from the BBC feed:.

Running and Building

This app was built with Android Studio 

Testing

I tested the app on my Samsung Galaxy S8.

Tidying up

4 hours is not a long time to come up with something good. Stuff was thrown together quickly here. The following is a list of things that need cleaning up:

Strings are hardcoded Comments are lacking No error checking Exceptions not handled correctly Inconsistent variable naming Tidy up code Probably loads more... More features with more time

Time ran out just when lots more features could be added such as:

cardviews,Recycler view. At present all the news are just displayed in Listview.

 Third party libraries not been used.Love to use Recycler View,Retrofit,Butterknife,Volley,Glide
